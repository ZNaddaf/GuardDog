    <h1>GuardDog – Basic Security Check</h1>
    <p>
        GuardDog is a small tool that runs a few basic security checks on this Windows computer
        and writes a report to this USB drive.
    </p>

    <h2>What GuardDog does</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reads some Windows security settings (like firewall and antivirus status).</li>
        <li>Does not change any settings.</li>
        <li>Does not connect to the internet.</li>
        <li>Saves a report as an HTML file in a <code>reports</code> folder next to this file.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Plug this USB drive into the Windows computer you want to check.</li>
        <li>Open the USB drive in File Explorer.</li>
        <li>Double-click <strong>GuardDog.exe</strong>.</li>
        <li>Wait a short moment; a report file will appear in a <code>reports</code> folder.</li>
        <li>Double-click the report file to open it in your web browser.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is an early version of GuardDog; some checks may not be implemented yet.</p>
